        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p> Diagno is a Web Application where you can check if you have pulmonary diseases.
            You can upload your X-ray and get your result.</p>
        <p>The algorithm
            behind is able to detect Pneumonia or SARS-COV-2 disease using Deep Learning models for classification.
            This Interface has a demonstration purpose of the researched algorithm trained on a big dataset in order to
            obtain the best result possible. </p>

    <section id="32-the user-gets-his-result" role="doc-structure">
        <h3>3.2. The user gets his result</h3>
        <p>This is when the user uploads this X-ray from his personal computer and after this he receive a response with
            a specific accuracy.</p>
        <p>The algorithm will return one of the following outputs: Normal if there are no signs of problems, Viral
            Pneumonia or Sars-Cov-2, followed by the accuracy of the classification </a>.</p>
